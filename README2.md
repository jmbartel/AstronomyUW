**Sprint Review (4 points)** <br>
**a. What did you learn from doing our first sprint?** <br>
From doing the first sprint, we learned more about the importance of using branches for our second sprint, which allowed us to get everything together and make it more accessible to connect together as an end result. We also had a better delegation of tasks. <br>
**b. What did go well? Why?** <br>
For this sprint, we did a good job communicating by updating each other on issues and where we were at. This made it simple for us to know when to take actions like a pull when necessary. When we said we would do something, we followed through with it. We also did a good job meeting frequently as a group. <br>
**c. What didnâ€™t go well? Why not?** <br>
For what did not go well, we had problems with Firebase redeploy because we had not done it in over a month when we decided to do it. It took a lot of time, but the issue was resolved. In the last sprint, we had stuff done very early, and this time, even though we are on schedule, it feels like we are rushing more at the end. Communication with the client has been difficult because of delays in responses and the difficulty of connecting our aesthetic visions with theirs. <br>
**d. How can you make things better next time?** <br>
Next time, we can manage our time like the first sprint, where we felt like we were more ahead instead of rushing at the very end. We could also try to communicate more frequently with the client. <br>
**e. Are you satisfied with what you already completed?** <br>
We are very satisfied with what we have already completed because the functionality is more than we planned for the sprint, and a lot of it works at a high level.  <br>
**f. Which group was invited? What are your observations/notes? Everybody was present?** <br>
Everyone from both teams was present, and we did our sprint review with Team 6. From the first sprint, they got better at using branches and dividing up the work despite it being hard with JavaScript. They also improved their merging issues. Time management, merging, authentification, and debugging went well for the group. For what did not go well, the Trello was hard to follow, and timelines of everything; the calendar did not go well, and there is still troubleshooting with that. There were issues with database connections and extracting those fields for the point page. They also ran out of storage on Frida night. Next time, They hope to update the Trello a bit more to prevent issues that arose this time and to distribute the work a bit more (hard to do) because of the storage problem/usage, and they are satisfied with the work completed so far. <br>
